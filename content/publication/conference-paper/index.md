  Modern cities in Europe and the World face many challenges that are caused by
  growth, both economic

  and population. To overcome these challenges it is necessary to integrate advanced technologies into our cities, as well as wider society, through process of digital transformations that will lead to evolution of the better, smart cities. One challenge that is encountered by Sarajevo, capital and largest city in Bosnia and Herzegovina is lack of available parking space. Possible solution to this problem is considered in this paper. The implemented solution of the issue requires the development of a well-integrated Application Programming Interface, that will be connected to the sensors installed at the parking spaces. Furthermore, the solution includes a mobile application that will communicate with the API and allow the users of the application to gain insight relating to the car-parks that are implementing sensors and are registered to the API, in particular the users will be able to view exact location of the car-park, and get instructions on how to reach a particular car-park. Furthermore, the users will be able to see number of available parking spaces at particular car-park, place reservation for a parking space, as well as pay for the parking services through the mobile application. This paper posits that this solution will allow drivers, and parking users, to find parking space more easily, thus reducing time spent in vehicle searching for suitable parking, and thus increase their productivity and improve their overall experience of driving in urban areas, as well as facilitation of transactions between parking users and parking operators. The implementation of this system has the potential to improve monitoring and manageability of parking spaces which in turn may vastly improve parking availability in Sarajevo.
